1|1| I am putting in a claim on the car insurance that I currently have with you. My policy number is
2|1| 457196. Last week, I was rear-ended at Highway 32 by another vehicle. He was speeding and had cut me
3|1| off, despite the fact that I signaled earlier that I was going onto exit 76. I have attached the car
4|1| owner's details and the police report that I filed. There seems to be some problems regarding his own
5|1| auto insurance policy, which is why I am forced to take out the costs for repairs from my own insurance.
6|1| I have also included the repair details that I got from three different car shops. I hope that you find
7|1| this information sufficient to process my request. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me at 333-3333.
8|1| I really hope to get my car fixed at the soonest possible date. Thank you. - See more at: http://www.samplelettersworld.com/sample-letters/requisition-letters/1000-make-an-insurance-claim-sample-letter-1#sthash.C2P3COny.dpuf
9|2| As I informed you by letter of January 17, 20xx, I was injured in an automobile accident with your insured
10|2| Matthew White on January 13, 20xx in Highgate, Connecticut. I was headed west on Hornsey Lane and stopped at
11|2| the stop sign at the intersection with Highgate Hill Road. While I was stopped, your insured slammed into the
12|2| back of my car. The force of the blow threw me forward against my shoulder restraints, and my head snapped forward and back.
13|3| The purpose of this letter is to request full reimbursement for my family's personal property that was destroyed
14|3| (date of loss). The total value of the items that were deemed a total loss is $500,000. As you know, we have
15|3| answered every request for information from (insurance company). We have made the property available for
16|3| inspection multiple times and cooperated fully in providing documentation of our losses.
17|4| As you know, I was injured when your insured entered an intersection without stopping at a stop sign. I underwent
18|4| over sixteen months of medical and chiropractic care, and still I have residual pain when I exert my body.
19|4| I was able to return to work, although I lost some time due to pain and additional time for doctors' appointments.
20|4| Once you have reviewed this letter and all the documents in the file, I believe you will agree with me that this
21|4| case has a settlement value of no less than $19,200, all inclusive. That is the amount I am demanding in compensation for this injury.
